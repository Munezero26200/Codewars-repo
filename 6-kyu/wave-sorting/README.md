<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/596f28fd9be8ebe6ec0000c1/train/javascript target="_blank">Wave Sorting</a></h2><h3>6 kyu</h3><p>A list of integers is sorted in “Wave” order if alternate items are not less than their immediate neighbors (thus the other alternate items are not greater than their immediate neighbors).</p><p>Thus, the array <code>[4, 1, 7, 5, 6, 2, 3]</code> is in <strong>Wave</strong> order because 4 &gt;= 1, then 1 &lt;= 7, then 7 &gt;= 5, then 5 &lt;= 6, then 6 &gt;= 2, and finally 2 &lt;= 3.</p><p>The wave-sorted lists has to begin with an element not less than the next, so <code>[1, 4, 5, 3]</code> is not sorted in Wave because 1 &lt; 4</p><p>Your task is to implement a function that takes a list of integers and sorts it into wave order in place; your function shouldn't return anything.</p><p>Note:</p><ul><li>The resulting array shouldn't necessarily match anyone in the tests, a function just checks if the array is now wave sorted.</li></ul>
